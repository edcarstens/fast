# FAST (Features And Sections Templater)

FAST is a generic Python-based templater which can be used for developing nodejs apps. Once file templates have been setup, features can be added to the app. One feature may add lines to multiple sections in multiple files. JS-specific FAST packages can aid in speedy code development. A new feature can be contained in one FAST file so that all elements related to that feature can be viewed easily without having to search and open multiple files. Also, a feature can easily be removed or updated by only modifying its FAST file.
